## Overview
This project is a simple showcase of the implementation of a RESTful API for CRUD operations using Go Fiber, using a Docker environment, instrumented by Prometheus
and with Grafana available.

## How to run the project:
Clone the repository then run `docker-compose up -d`. The API should be available at `localhost:4000`. My recommendation is to start this project as a stack in
Portainer.
